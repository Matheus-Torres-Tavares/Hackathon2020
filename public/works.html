      <div>Works:

        I take extreme pride in my work as an accountant. I am often considered a leader both in my department and among
        all employees in the Scranton branch. I can also let go and have fun with my coworkers and have enjoyed singing
        karaoke with them at our annual Christmas party, as long as itâ€™s religious songs only, please (I do not condone
        loud music).

        <p>My past works and achievements include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bachelor's degree in accounting and CPA certified</li>
          <li>Headed the Party Planning Committee and organized multiple office events, both professional and
            celebratory.</li>
          <li>Vet certified cat rescuer</li>
          <li>Member of the Scranton Cat Appreciation society</li>
          <li>Cats rights activist / vegetarian</li>
          <li>Fashion expert (for appropriate conservative wear only: sweaters and muted colors never go out of style)
          </li>
        </ul>
